README: FlexAlloc Dynamic Memory Allocator

### Provided Files
README   link to project page and info about other files
Makefile used by make to build a shared object file needed for testing
FlexAlloc.h header file with the signatures for public "shared" functions
FlexAlloc.c source code with functions completed

### To build FlexAlloc object file:
COMPILE  make         (this will build FlexAlloc.o and libheap.so)

### To test heap functions:
cd tests              (change to the tests sub-directory)
make                  (compiles all tests and runs test_align1)
make partA            (runs the tests that only require balloc works)
make partB            (runs the tests that require balloc and bfree)
make partC            (runs the tests that require balloc, bfree with immediate coalescing)
